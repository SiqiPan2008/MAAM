MMM: 016 = VGG16; 018 = ResNet18; 050 = ResNet50; 152 = ResNet152; 000 = Diagnosis model, not CNN
NN: AO = OCT abnormity model; AF = Fundusabnormity model; D1 = first diagnosis model; D2 = second diagnosis model;
II: TR: train data; TO: test other data; TI: test inside of train data
TT: RS - acc/... result; WT - weight; MR - model results
[Additional]: TdddDDD = Temporary transfer learning best model from epoch ddd to epoch DDD
              Tddd = model at epoch ddd; this is the best transfer learning model in a certain epoch range
